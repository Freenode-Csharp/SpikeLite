  This file governs our log4net logging. We're set up to rehash our repository on changes to this file. Our current
  logging setup is that INFO+ messages get put into our spikelite.log with a rather standard format, and that
  debug level logs show up on STDOUT. I tried to set up 2 colorized appenders for STDOUT, one for raw send and one
  for raw receive, but the filters didn't seem to work on string pattern matching.
  
  Our default level of logging is INFO, so you'll want to override any non-default values here, which should
  propagate without a restart. You'll probably want to add another appender.
  
  Alternatively, if you'd like to toggle the treshold of your appenders at runtime, please see the LoggingModule.cs in the administrative modules. This will not alter
  the filtering that comes out of the box (see below), but it will toggle what your existing appenders threshold's are.
